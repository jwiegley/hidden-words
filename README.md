# The Hidden Words

This is a bilingual typesetting of the Hidden Words, by Bahá'u'lláh. It was
created for three reasons:

 1. Provide an easier path to memorize by breaking up the input text according
    to its verses and rhyming patterns;

 2. Clarify pronunciation by providing diacriticals for all uncommon words;

 3. Aid Persian learners by defining uncommon words.

If you have xelatex installed, just type `make`. If you have Nix installed you
can build with:

    nix build -f .

The resulting PDF will be in `./result/share/doc/pdf/hidden-words.pdf`.
